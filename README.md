### Requirements
1. Develop the HTML/CSS/JS front-end to support a pre-defined Rails API backend. (We will give you a starter back end to work with.) The domain model consists of Users and Notes. Each user has many notes.
2. These Frontend and Backend will live in two separate repositories. All interactions between the client and the server should be handled asynchronously (Ajax / fetch).
3. The application should support:
    1. Selection of a user (no log in though - all info will be public)
    2. Listing all of that user's notes on a sidebar
    3. Display the details of the currently selected note on the body of the page.
    4. Allow users to create, edit and delete notes.
    5. The notes should be sorted based on their last edit time.
    6. Bonus: Support rich formatting (Bold, italic, underline).
    7. Feel free to add on your own ideas if you have built all of the above!  
3. 4. **You may not use authentication or authorization. This means no user log in**. We'll look at patterns for dealing with client-side auth later in the semester, so you'll have plenty of time to deal with this case.
